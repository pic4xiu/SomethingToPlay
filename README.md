## gofuzz
> [Just write some fuzz test programs](https://github.com/pic4xiu/SomethingToPlay/tree/main/gofuzz)

fuzzer is another project that is still under development (I don't know when to develop it again, perhaps when I have gone through the AFL-fuzz source code).Now it's the simplest version 0.1, maybe you can read it in a few minutes

## tampermonkey plugin
 - [Send all the urls you visit to the remote server to build your own data set](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/468709-plugins-for-capturing-urls/code)

## ida pro plugin
 - [The ida script plug-in that automatically recognizes the address of the basic block of the program helps to set a breakpoint for the basic block in the fuzz phase](https://github.com/pic4xiu/SomethingToPlay/blob/main/idap/autoBreak.py)
